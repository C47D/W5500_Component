# UDP - User Datagram Protocol (RFC 768)

One of the core members of the interne protocol suite, with UDP,
computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as
datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication
channels or data paths.

UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum
of protocol mechanism. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and
port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and
destination of the datagram.

## Attibutes

- It's transaction-oriented
- It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols such
    as IP tunneling or Remote Procedure Call and the Network File System
- It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping, DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol
- It is stateless
- Lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable for real-time applications
    such as Voice over IP, online games.
- Supports multicast

## Service ports

An application binds a socket to its endpoint of data transmission, which is a
combination of an IP address and a service port (0 - 65535 (16bit integer)).
Port 0 is reserved.

UDP provides application multiplexing and integrity verification (via checksum)
of the header and payload.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has divided port numbers into
three ranges.
- Port numbers 0 through 1023 are used for common, well-known services.
- Port numbers 1024 trough 49151 are the registeres ports used for IANA-registered
  services.
- Port numbers 49152 though 65535 are dynamic ports that are not officially designated
  for any specific service, and may be used for any purpose.

There also are used as ephemeral ports, from which software running on the host
may randomly choose a port in order to define itself.

## Packet structure

- Source port number
- Destination port number
- Length
- Checksum



# DNS - Domain Name System

Hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services,
or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
It associates various information with domain names assigned
to each of the participating entities.
Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain
names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and
identifying computer services and devices with the underlying
network protocols.

- DNS Protocol transport
DNS primarily uses the UDP on port 53 to serve requests. DNS queries
consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a single
UDP reply from the server.
When the length of the answer exceeds 512bytes and both client and
server support EDNS, larger UDP packets are used. Otherwise, the query
is sent again using the TCP, also used for tasks such as zone transfers.



# HTML Meta

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh

Meta refresh es un metodo para indicarle al web browser que automaticamente
refresque la pagina despues de cierto tiempo, indicado en segundos.
No es recomendado hacerlo ya que puede ocasionar problemas.

Para refrescar una pagina despues de 5 segundos:
<html>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">

Para redireccionar despues de 5 segundos
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;
url=http://example.com/">

Redireccionar inmediatamente:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;
url=http://example.com/">

## Alternativas

### Para refresh
Proveer un dispositivo de interaccion, como un boton,
para darle al usuario la opcion de elegir cuando refrescar
el contenido.
Otra opcion es usar una tecnica conocida como Ajax [1] para
update pastes de un sitio web sin la necesidad de refrezcar toda
la pagina, esto requiere que el usuario active JS en su browser.
