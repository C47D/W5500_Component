Los sockets del W5500 estan representados por un struct, de esta forma sabemos
su estado y diferentes propiedades sin necesidad de leer los registros del
W5500.

struct socket {
    socket_sts  status;
    uint32_t    base_address;
    uint16_t    port;
    uint8_t     protocol;
};

El struct socket no deberia de ser modificado por el usuario, las funciones
en socket.c son las encargadas de la modificacion de este struct.

Por defecto el registro Socket n Mode Register (SnMR) tiene un valor de 0x00
por lo que:

socket.protocol = Closed
socket.unicast blocking in udp mode: disabled
socket.use no delayed ACK: disabled
socket.broadcast blocking in MACRAW and UDO mode: disabled
socket.multicasting in UDP mode: disabled

Sn_IR (Socket n Interrupt Register) [RCW1] [0x0002] [0x00]
Indicates the status of Socket Interrupt such as establishment, termination,
receiving data, timeout. When an interrupt occurs and the corresponding bit of
Sn_IMR is 1, the corresponding bit of Sn_IR becomes 1.
In order to clear the Sn_IR bit, the host should write the bit to 1.

Bit     Symbol      Description
4       SEND_OK     This is issued when SEND command is completed.
3       TIMEOUT     This is issued when ARP_TO or TCP_TO occurs.
2       RECV        This is issued whenever data is received from a peer.
1       DISCON      This is issued when FIN or FIN/ACK packet is received from a peer.
0       CON         This is issued one time when the connection with peer is successful
                    and then SN_SR is changed to SOCK_ESTABLISHED
